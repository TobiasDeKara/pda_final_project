## Introduction

In this paper we replicate an analysis published in JAMA Network Open by Benjamin P. Brown, MD, MS; Luciana E. Hebert, PhD; Melissa Gilliam, MD, MPH;  and Robert Kaestner, PhD, entitled "Association of Highly Restrictive State Abortion Policies With Abortion Rates, 2000-2014."  We then extend this analysis by considering . . . 

The data set from the Brown et al. article was not made public, and due to limitations of publicly available data, we have narrowed the scope of our replication to analyzing a single year. Specifically we analyzed data from 2010, primarily because this was the year within the original paper's time range for which we had the most detailed information on state legislation restricting abortions.


## Study Design

We used a propensity weighted linear model to assess the association of restrictive abortion legislation and abortion rates.  We used data from the same set of 18 states as Brown et al., and used propensity weighting to account for differences between those states and the other 32 states.  The propensity weights were calculated using the same set of county level covariates as Brown et al.: number of women, percentages of population by race, median household income, and percentage of voters who voted for the Democratic presidential candidate in 2008. 

## Participants, Variables and Data Sources

We used abortion count data compiled by Wm. Robert Johnston and available at www.johnstonsarchive.net/policy/abortion.  At least partial data was available for all 18 of the states included in the analysis by Brown et al., and for most of those states we had data for more than 80% of the counties (see Table 1).  The percentages of counties reporting were similar to the percentages reporting in Brown et al.

For assessment of state legislation restricting abortion, we used data from the Guttmacher Institute which identified states with laws of the same four types used by Brown et al.: gestational age restrictions, targeted restrictions on abortion providers (TRAP) laws, requirements for patients to make at least two trips to a clinic, and mandated parental involvement for patients who are minors. Following Brown et al.'s methodology, we classified states as "highly restrictive" if they had 3/4 types of laws. 

The covariates for the propensity score model were taken from the US Census Bureau
